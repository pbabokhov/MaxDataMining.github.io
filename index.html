       K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN, is a supervised non-parametric lazy algorithm, first proposed by Evelyn Fix and J.L. Hodges in 1951 
       and improved upon by Thomas Cover in 1968. The basic premise of KNN is that there is an initial data point/sample, and we want
       to find a new sample. In this case, we calculate the k nearest neighbors (with k being a positive number). Thus, if k=1, then the 
       new point is assigned to the single closest neighbor. If k=2, the sample is assigned to the two closest neighbors, and so on.
       KNN can be used for both classification and regression.
       
       The most common measurement for KNN is Euclidean Distance. The math formula is given below:
       
                                D(xi, xj) = [(sum from i=1 to k * (xi - xj)^2)]^1/2
       
       Where xi and xj are the initially-labeled/input sample and the new sample, respectively, and k is the nearest neighbor to the new sample.
                                      
       KNN is non-parametric because there is no assumption about the data fits any sort of parameterized distribution. KNN is a popular algorithm to use 
       for machine learning because it is simple and because the training time is very quick, due to the method being a lazy algorithm. 
       That is, all the data is stored during the training phase, but the algorithm does not learn on the data until after classification. 
       This is good for cases when the distribution of the data is unknown, or in experiments when a quick classification is needed. 
       
       The status of KNN as a lazy algorithm also comes with disadvantages. One disadvantage is the calculation complexity. This stems from 
       KNN's retention of all the training data until testing. The algorithm calculates the distance between every sample within the training set
       This means that if there is a lot of data, the calculations of similarity between two training samples will take a long time. 
       Another disadvantage is that because KNN does not learn on the training set, it is not able to predict upon any newly-introduced data. 
       In addition, the training data This is why choosing a large enough value of k is important, because it will mitigate the noise. 
       But this may lead to the model undefitting the data, if the k is too big. If the k is too small, 
       
       The following is a simple flow chart of the classification process by KNN. It is based off Fig. 4 of the paper by Al-Faiz and Miry
       (http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/48531)
       
                                           select and define k 
                                                    v
                                                    v
                         compute the Euclidean distance between the initial and new samples
                                                    v
                                                    v
                                             sort the distances 
          -> select the k nearest neighbors to the new sample -> 
                                             
       
       There are a number of improvements that have been proposed and implemented to make KNN These improvements include
