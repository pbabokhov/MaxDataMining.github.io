       K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN, is a non-parametric lazy algorithm. That is, the algorithm does not make the assumption that the data
       fits any sort of parameterized distribution. KNN is a popular algorithm to use for machine learning because it is simple and 
       because the training time is very quick. This has to do with the method being a lazy algorithm. That is, the data is stored during
       the training phase, but the algorithm does not learn on the data until after classification. Futhermore, the entire training data
       is used.
